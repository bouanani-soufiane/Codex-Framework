# Codex Framework

Codex is a lightweight Java framework that provides dependency injection, custom ORM, data mapping, and automated database table creation to facilitate the development of scalable and maintainable applications.

## Features

- **Dependency Injection**: Streamline object creation and dependency management.
- **Custom ORM**: Simplify database interactions with an intuitive ORM.
- **Data Mapping**: Effortlessly map database tables to Java objects.
- **Automated Table Creation**: Automatically generate database tables from your Java classes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 8 or higher
- Maven

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:bouanani-soufiane/Codex-Framework.git

   ```


## Usage

### Dependency Injection

Codex uses [Burningwave](https://github.com/burningwave/core) for classpath scanning to enable dependency injection.

### Example

```java
// soon..
```

### Resources that helps me

- This [article](https://dev.to/jjbrt/how-to-create-your-own-dependency-injection-framework-in-java-4eaj) was very helpful in the development of Codex dependency injection.
